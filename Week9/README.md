# Project 9 - Honeypot

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total


> Objective: To create a basic Honeypot and demonstrate its effectiveness

## Honeypots deployed
I deployed 2 dionaea with http and one shockpot. My first honeypot got attacked quite a few times
 the last time I checked while the shockpot didn't get attacked at all.

## Issues encountered
The main issue was just the configuration and setup for the assignment. Besides that
it was fairly straightforward

## Summary of data collected
I created 3 honeypots: 2 dionaea with http and one shockpot.
1 dionaea got attacked 1055 times last I checked while the other got attacked 81 times.
Shockpot still stands at 0
Top 5 attacked ports were: port 23, 80, 445, 8088,3389

## Unresolved questions
My top 5 attack signatures remained blank and I want to know why.
Other than that this assignment was interesting and fun to do.
