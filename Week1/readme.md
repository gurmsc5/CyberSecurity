GIF created with [Peek] (https://github.com/phw/peek#debian) and [LICEcap] (https://www.cockos.com/licecap/)
Work originally done in Burp suite included in Kali-Rolling virtual machine
Windows 10 was used for gifs later because Peek was not rendering gifs properly in Kali(Debian) and LICEcap is more convenient

## Notes
Burp was fairly straightforward and convenient to use. Facebook was a little tricky to use Burp with initially but it wasn't an issue. 
I am having difficulty with bonus Challenge 6 which requires decoding of userid but I'm working on it.
